Introduction:

A matlab code Time_indepdent_Gross_Pitaevskii_eq_1D.m computes 1D time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii equation for Bose-Einstein condensation using pseudospectral method.

Requirement:

Any version of Matlab software.

Implementation details and running

The code use a code legDC2.m, which computes the Legendre differentiation matrix with collocation at the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto nodes and corresponding weights.
You may download them and run the codes directly.
